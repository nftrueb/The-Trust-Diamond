## Use Case Abstract
In todays world Discover reaches out to any government agency or credit bureau for any information pertaining to a customer or prospective customer. There is obviously a wait time ranging from couple days to couple weeks before getting the information. Scenarios could be when applying for a new loan/credit card or existing customer having to go through credit bureau check during scenarios related to fraud on the account. 

In the future if customer can just provide the Digital credential(for verification) to Discover during the credit card application process or when his account is on hold for further information from agencies. Using the digital credential provided by the customer, Discover which is the verifier would  verify the customer with the agency which is the Issuer. This is both faster, secure and a time saver for all parties involved.

Challenge would be that all the parties involved should be ready to enbrace the technology and make themselves capable of issuing or verifying credentials.
